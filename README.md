Welcome 

These are some solved exercises from the Eloquent JavaScript book. These cover chapter 3 to chapter 4. Some exercises have more than one solution involving different methods such as repetition and recursion.
The names in the .js files mean what it is, in this case they will all be called exercise and then the chapter number will come followed by a dash and the chapter exercise number.
